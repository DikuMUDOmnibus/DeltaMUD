------------------------------------

We have taken steps towards completing the first start town
(zone 1, Itrius). All room descriptions have been completed,
many mobs have been added, and several shops opened. I must
apologize for the lack of different armor and weapons, as we
are still working on item specifics. Right now there is a small
knife you can buy and leather armor... that's about it.

Please be advised that while it is possible to gain levels by
killing city-folk, it may be unwise, since your alignment will
become evil quite rapidly, and we will be adding law enforcement to
city areas soon.

We have also become aware of an issue regarding the death and
moving of many NPCs/mobs in town. This is due to the weather, and
we are looking into this.

Much more is in store.

For news check out the 'news' command, which will now be updated
once in awhile.
