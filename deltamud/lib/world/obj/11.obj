a large brown pillar~
A large deteriorating brown pillar stands here.~
   The pillar looks very old, in fact you can watch it crumble as small pieces
of it roll down out of cracks in it's side.  It has deteriorated so much that
there is a large pile of tiny pieces of it lying around the base.  It is about
seven feet tall, and standing about five feet from the treeline it is dwarfed
by the giant trees, but is still an impressive as an object made by man.  At
first the color of the pillar seems almost brown, but when you look closer you
can tell it was once a very bright white.  You wonder what material it was made
of, given the surroundings you realize someone would have had to bring the rock
from a far away place, and that just makes you wonder about who or what made it
and why.
