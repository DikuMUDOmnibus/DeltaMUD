altar~
   The altar is ancient, but looks as though it could have just been placed
here yesterday.  There is something about it that seems mystical, although you
cannot really figure out what.

 Welcome! If you are reading this, you have successfully chosen to
 embark on a wonderful adventure full of fun and exciting places
 to go, and people to see. If you are new to MUDs, you have just
 opened the first pages to a magical book. A book that exists
 for all who care to share in it. A world that continues to
 grow when you stop reading.

 ... Unfortunately, this game is still under heavy construction.
 Therefore, access to much of the game is still restricted. We
 still have much in store, as far as development goes. Maybe you
 are a fan of the works of fantasy writers and novelists such
 as C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and Neil
 Gaiman. Perhaps you are a historical enthusiast, who enjoys
 reading about the medieval kingdoms, or the ancient empires
 of Rome and Egypt. You may even just like role-playing games
 in general, or have nothing to do. Either way, you will find
 that this game is being inspired by the works of many great
 fantasy writers, fantasy games, and all things fantasy.
 We cordially welcome you to participate in this public beta
 test, and hope that you will enjoy our current work in
 progress.
