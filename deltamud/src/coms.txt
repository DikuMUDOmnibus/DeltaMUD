Explanation:
A base map that works like a coordinate system: 
Going south from 1A,1A takes you to 1A,2A.
Sector type 1B,2A is forest while sector type 2B,2A is mountain.
0B,2B is player's position... x marks the spot =).
e's are entries into the worldmap --- position yourself over them and type enter... viola... your in a zone.

-----
The worldmap is actually in a *modified* room structure (to provide compatibility for fighting and such in the world map - the mod will be a new "int room_enter" for a link to a zone).
Its formatted in worldmap[XY] form, X or Y is truncated to 5 numerics long dependant on what coordinate its at, like Y coord 5 will be 00005, Y coord 50000 will be 50000.

Plan:
When a player leaves a city [zone], they are extracted from the world map, set_bit(char, PLAYER_MAP), and have moving interpreted differently in act.movement.c to work under coordinates instead of exits.
When char positions themselves over a "e", they type enter and enter the room set in "int room_enter" in the room struct. They are sent to the appropriate room.

Thats it, have fun coding =)

Example:

/* Defines a sector type, how it shows up on the map (&GF = green colored F hehe), the name of all the rooms that are of this sector, the description of all the rooms with this sector, and how much moves this sector takes up. --- This definition should be done FIRST in the file. */
NewSector: F
SectShow: &GF
SectName: Questing Through Akashar Forest
SectMove: 3
SectDesc:
   You are wandering around in a large forest. The green shruberry
grows everywhere and large redwood trees extend high in the air. You
hear many small creatures rustling in the bushes and see the chirping
birds pirched up on the branches.

EndSector

NewSector: E
SectShow: &We
SectName: A City Entrance
SectMove: 1
SectDesc:
   You stand before the entrance to a city... it seems to be made
of large stone blocks in a sort of mosaic pattern. You consider the
notion of venturing inside and seeing what exactly is in there...
~
EndSector

NewSector: M
SectShow: &LM
SectName: On a Mountain Range
SectMove: 6
SectDesc:
   You are hiking on a HUGE mountain. The hard jagged rock here makes
it painful for you to walk and you understand why there is no vegetation
here. You see a wide, green forest in the distance.
